# GenerationSTEM-Tutorial
A GenerationSTEM block coding tutorial for fifth grade classes to prepare/teach students about block coding with Cue Robots. It starts by giving the student the option to start the block code activity or to watch the block code tutorial.

In the block code tutorial, there is an animation that explains the students what each component of the screen is meant for. Before students start the block code activity, there is a prompt of the task they should complete with the block code. Then it transitions to the block code activity screen.

There are four scenes in this Unity Project:

1. Start Scene - gives the 2 options to the students (start activity. tutorial)
2. Tutorial Scene - simple animation
3. Transition Scene - a simple animation that explains the prompt(the coding task students should do)
4. Game Sense - the block code activity
